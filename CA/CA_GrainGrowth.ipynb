    "\n",
    "The solidification of a material is a complex process, very difficult to model accurately. In the field of metallurgy it is important to understand how solidification happens, since this will impact the mechanical properties of the material. \n",
    "\n",
    "The following image shows 4, among the many, possible microscopic configurations of steel, after it has been cooled down in different conditions. Each one of them has different properties and is used for different purposes. Knowing exactly which configuration is growing when casting steel is important to obtain a material with specific properties.\n",

    "## Atoms and phases of matter\n",
    "\n",
    "The smallest constitutive unit of matter that we consider for materials is the atom, which can, for simplicity, be approximated by a sphere. Atoms can arrange in various ways, and different phases can exist. Normally we talk about gas (atoms don't have any structure), liquid (atoms are disordered, but stay close to each other), and solid (ordered and packed).\n",

    "<img src=\"images/statesofmatter.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"248\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "## Solid phase: crystals and grains\n",
    "\n",
    "However, even when all of the atoms are in the same phase, they can still show some differences. Atoms in the solid phase can arrange themselves differently, as it can be seen in the following figure, where 3 common solid arrangements of atoms are shown:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/scfccbcc.png\" width=\"559\" height=\"238\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "The same material, in different conditions, can show any of these (and many other!) configurations. Changes in chemical composition, pressure, temperature can drive the material from one structure to another. However, for the rest of the lecture, we will assume that all atoms have the same configuration (e.g. FCC) and not consider differences in this sense.\n",
    "\n",
    "A group of atoms sharing the same arrangement and direction is called a <b>crystal</b>. Crystals are formed upon solidifications, when the atoms begin to re-arrange themselves in an ordered manner. However we talk about a \"crystalline\" system only when all of the atoms have the same orientation, which is hardly ever the case. It can happen that the atoms will have different orientations, different general directions, even if their internal arrangement is the same. In this case we talk about a polycristalline structure and we introduce the concept of grain.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/crystal-poly.png\" width=\"325\" height=\"200\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "A <b>grain</b> is a single crystal surrounded by other crystals of the same type, but at different orientations. Multiple grains, each oriented in a different manner, form the solid as we know it. The orientation, form and dimension of the grains are controlled by many factors, such as the cooling rate (the velocity at which the temperature is lowered) and the amount of other elements in the material, and affects the mechanical properties of the solid.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following figure we can clearly see different grains, i.e. different groups of atoms that oriented in the same manner. The border between two crystals is called \"grain boundary\" and it is also important to know how it is shaped and the angle between different grains.\n",
    "<img src=\"images/grains-HRTEM-2.png\" width=\"454\" height=\"287\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore it is necessary to study how different parameters can influence the microscopic picture, in order to drive the solidification towards the system with the most interesting mechanical properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Solidification\n",
    "\n",
    "Solidification is the process or re-arrangement of the atoms from a very chaotic state to a very compact and ordinated one.\n",
    "\n",
    "At microscopic level it is very complex and till today remains one of the biggest challenges in computational materials science. There are two main concept to understand in order to make a reasonable model:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Solidification is an activated process\n",
    "   - Solidification is driven by temperature\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "### Activated process\n",
    "\n",
    "Solidification does not happen at the same time everywhere, as the atoms do not tend to spontaneously re-arrange in a solid form on their own. It is usually necessary to wait for an \"event\" which creates a <b>seed</b> for the solidification. What happens in experiments is that a very small part of the liquid becomes solid (either spontaneously or due to some type of interaction) and forms a (small) solid seed. After this, all the liquid attached to it will start to solidify as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/GrainGrowth.gif\" width=\"226\" height=\"198\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "### Driven by temperature\n",
    "\n",
    "It is normally said that a liquid, once it has reached the solidification temperature, will become solid. However, this is not completely true. What really happens is that the liquid can be cooled beyond the transition temperature, before starting to solidify.\n",
    "\n",
    "The lower is the temperature of the liquid, the higher the probability that a seed will appear and will start to solidify together with its surrounding atoms. Therefore a seed that appears early will have more time to solidify the liquid, growing bigger than other grains.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Modelling grain growth with a CA\n",
    "\n",
    "Keeping in mind these two concepts, we can imagine what is necessary in order to provide a reasonable model of solidification, using a CA. We have to introduce a seed in the system, from which the solidification will have origin, at a temperature that is different for each seed. This will change the dimension and shape of the grain during its growth.\n",
    "\n",
    "Grains differ one from the other in terms of relative orientation of the atoms and this will be highlighted by using different colors for each grain. In reality each one, with its own orientation, will grow only following a certain direction and shape, however in this simple model we are going to disregard that.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this simple model we are going to assume that the temperature at which seeds appear at the border and in the center of the liquid can differ. This reflects the fact that the liquid can interact with external factors that will make the seed appear first in either region.\n",
    "\n",
    "The grains will grow by \"capturing\" the neighboring cells. The velocity of growth depends on the local supercooling of the liquid, which keeps increasing over time (as the liquid gets colder and colder).\n",
    "\n",
    "Differently from before, the CA does not have periodic boundary conditions and cells at the border will not interact with those at the other side.\n",
    "\n",
